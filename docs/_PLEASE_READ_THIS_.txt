Please copy the supplied .pdf files to your C:\ drive or else they will not display properly in our HMI. 
Everything else will work, but you won't be able to open manuals from HMI.

We also recommend that you skip through the suplied manual before evaluating our solution to get a basic 
understaning of how it works and avoid any possible confusion.

Thank you, Team Konti
